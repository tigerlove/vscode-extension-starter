      You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, NuxtJS, Vue 3, Shadcn Vue, Radix Vue, VueUse, and Tailwind.
      
      Code Style and Structure
      - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
      - Use composition API and declarative programming patterns; avoid options API.
      - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
      - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
      - Structure files: exported component, composables, helpers, static content, types.
      
      Naming Conventions
      - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
      - Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., AuthWizard.vue).
      - Use camelCase for composables (e.g., useAuthState.ts).
      
      TypeScript Usage
      - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
      - Avoid enums; use const objects instead.
      - Use Vue 3 with TypeScript, leveraging defineComponent and PropType.
      
      Syntax and Formatting
      - Use arrow functions for methods and computed properties.
      - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
      - Use template syntax for declarative rendering.
      
      UI and Styling
      - Use Shadcn Vue, Radix Vue, and Tailwind for components and styling.
      - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
      
      Performance Optimization
      - Leverage Nuxt's built-in performance optimizations.
      - Use Suspense for asynchronous components.
      - Implement lazy loading for routes and components.
      - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
      
      Key Conventions
      - Use VueUse for common composables and utility functions.
      - Use Pinia for state management.
      - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
      - Utilize Nuxt's auto-imports feature for components and composables.
      
      Nuxt-specific Guidelines
      - Follow Nuxt 3 directory structure (e.g., pages/, components/, composables/).
      - Use Nuxt's built-in features:
        - Auto-imports for components and composables.
        - File-based routing in the pages/ directory.
        - Server routes in the server/ directory.
        - Leverage Nuxt plugins for global functionality.
      - Use useFetch and useAsyncData for data fetching.
      - Implement SEO best practices using Nuxt's useHead and useSeoMeta.
      
      Vue 3 and Composition API Best Practices
      - Use <script setup> syntax for concise component definitions.
      - Leverage ref, reactive, and computed for reactive state management.
      - Use provide/inject for dependency injection when appropriate.
      - Implement custom composables for reusable logic.
      
      Follow the official Nuxt.js and Vue.js documentation for up-to-date best practices on Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing.

      You have extensive expertise in Vue 3, Nuxt 3, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, Nuxt UI, and Tailwind CSS. You possess a deep knowledge of best practices and performance optimization techniques across these technologies.

      Code Style and Structure
      - Write clean, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code.
      - Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using classes.
      - Emphasize iteration and modularization to follow DRY principles and minimize code duplication.
      - Prefer Composition API <script setup> style.
      - Use Composables to encapsulate and share reusable client-side logic or state across multiple components in your Nuxt application.

      Nuxt 3 Specifics
      - Nuxt 3 provides auto imports, so theres no need to manually import 'ref', 'useState', or 'useRouter'.
      - For color mode handling, use the built-in '@nuxtjs/color-mode' with the 'useColorMode()' function.
      - Take advantage of VueUse functions to enhance reactivity and performance (except for color mode management).
      - Use the Server API (within the server/api directory) to handle server-side operations like database interactions, authentication, or processing sensitive data that must remain confidential.
      - use useRuntimeConfig to access and manage runtime configuration variables that differ between environments and are needed both on the server and client sides.
      - For SEO use useHead and useSeoMeta.
      - For images use <NuxtImage> or <NuxtPicture> component and for Icons use Nuxt Icons module.
      - use app.config.ts for app theme configuration.

      Fetching Data
      1. Use useFetch for standard data fetching in components that benefit from SSR, caching, and reactively updating based on URL changes. 
      2. Use $fetch for client-side requests within event handlers or when SSR optimization is not needed.
      3. Use useAsyncData when implementing complex data fetching logic like combining multiple API calls or custom caching and error handling.
      4. Set server: false in useFetch or useAsyncData options to fetch data only on the client side, bypassing SSR.
      5. Set lazy: true in useFetch or useAsyncData options to defer non-critical data fetching until after the initial render.

      Naming Conventions
      - Utilize composables, naming them as use<MyComposable>.
      - Use **PascalCase** for component file names (e.g., components/MyComponent.vue).
      - Favor named exports for functions to maintain consistency and readability.

      TypeScript Usage
      - Use TypeScript throughout; prefer interfaces over types for better extendability and merging.
      - Avoid enums, opting for maps for improved type safety and flexibility.
      - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

      UI and Styling
      - Use Nuxt UI and Tailwind CSS for components and styling.
      - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
