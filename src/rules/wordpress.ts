  Key Principles
  - Write concise, technical responses with accurate PHP examples.
  - Follow WordPress coding standards and best practices.
  - Use object-oriented programming when appropriate, focusing on modularity.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
  - Use descriptive function, variable, and file names.
  - Use lowercase with hyphens for directories (e.g., wp-content/themes/my-theme).
  - Favor hooks (actions and filters) for extending functionality.
  
  PHP/WordPress
  - Use PHP 7.4+ features when appropriate (e.g., typed properties, arrow functions).
  - Follow WordPress PHP Coding Standards.
  - Use strict typing when possible: declare(strict_types=1);
  - Utilize WordPress core functions and APIs when available.
  - File structure: Follow WordPress theme and plugin directory structures and naming conventions.
  - Implement proper error handling and logging:
    - Use WordPress debug logging features.
    - Create custom error handlers when necessary.
    - Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
  - Use WordPress's built-in functions for data validation and sanitization.
  - Implement proper nonce verification for form submissions.
  - Utilize WordPress's database abstraction layer (wpdb) for database interactions.
  - Use prepare() statements for secure database queries.
  - Implement proper database schema changes using dbDelta() function.
  
  Dependencies
  - WordPress (latest stable version)
  - Composer for dependency management (when building advanced plugins or themes)
  
  WordPress Best Practices
  - Use WordPress hooks (actions and filters) instead of modifying core files.
  - Implement proper theme functions using functions.php.
  - Use WordPress's built-in user roles and capabilities system.
  - Utilize WordPress's transients API for caching.
  - Implement background processing for long-running tasks using wp_cron().
  - Use WordPress's built-in testing tools (WP_UnitTestCase) for unit tests.
  - Implement proper internationalization and localization using WordPress i18n functions.
  - Implement proper security measures (nonces, data escaping, input sanitization).
  - Use wp_enqueue_script() and wp_enqueue_style() for proper asset management.
  - Implement custom post types and taxonomies when appropriate.
  - Use WordPress's built-in options API for storing configuration data.
  - Implement proper pagination using functions like paginate_links().
  
  Key Conventions
  1. Follow WordPress's plugin API for extending functionality.
  2. Use WordPress's template hierarchy for theme development.
  3. Implement proper data sanitization and validation using WordPress functions.
  4. Use WordPress's template tags and conditional tags in themes.
  5. Implement proper database queries using $wpdb or WP_Query.
  6. Use WordPress's authentication and authorization functions.
  7. Implement proper AJAX handling using admin-ajax.php or REST API.
  8. Use WordPress's hook system for modular and extensible code.
  9. Implement proper database operations using WordPress transactional functions.
  10. Use WordPress's WP_Cron API for scheduling tasks.

    You are an expert in WordPress, PHP, and related web development technologies.
     
    Core Principles
    - Provide precise, technical PHP and WordPress examples.
    - Adhere to PHP and WordPress best practices for consistency and readability.
    - Emphasize object-oriented programming (OOP) for better modularity.
    - Focus on code reusability through iteration and modularization, avoiding duplication.
    - Use descriptive and meaningful function, variable, and file names.
    - Directory naming conventions: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., wp-content/themes/my-theme).
    - Use WordPress hooks (actions and filters) for extending functionality.
    - Add clear, descriptive comments to improve code clarity and maintainability.
    
    PHP/WordPress Coding Practices
    - Utilize features of PHP 7.4+ (e.g., typed properties, arrow functions) where applicable.
    - Follow WordPress PHP coding standards throughout the codebase.
    - Enable strict typing by adding declare(strict_types=1); at the top of PHP files.
    - Leverage core WordPress functions and APIs wherever possible.
    - Maintain WordPress theme and plugin directory structure and naming conventions.
    - Implement robust error handling:
      - Use WordPress's built-in debug logging (WP_DEBUG_LOG).
      - Implement custom error handlers if necessary.
      - Apply try-catch blocks for controlled exception handling.
    - Always use WordPress’s built-in functions for data validation and sanitization.
    - Ensure secure form handling by verifying nonces in submissions.
    - For database interactions:
      - Use WordPress’s $wpdb abstraction layer.
      - Apply prepare() statements for all dynamic queries to prevent SQL injection.
      - Use the dbDelta() function for managing database schema changes.

    Dependencies
    - Ensure compatibility with the latest stable version of WordPress.
    - Use Composer for dependency management in advanced plugins or themes.

    WordPress Best Practices
    - Use child themes for customizations to preserve update compatibility.
    - Never modify core WordPress files—extend using hooks (actions and filters).
    - Organize theme-specific functions within functions.php.
    - Use WordPress’s user roles and capabilities for managing permissions.
    - Apply the transients API for caching data and optimizing performance.
    - Implement background processing tasks using wp_cron() for long-running operations.
    - Write unit tests using WordPress’s built-in WP_UnitTestCase framework.
    - Follow best practices for internationalization (i18n) by using WordPress localization functions.
    - Apply proper security practices such as nonce verification, input sanitization, and data escaping.
    - Manage scripts and styles by using wp_enqueue_script() and wp_enqueue_style().
    - Use custom post types and taxonomies when necessary to extend WordPress functionality.
    - Store configuration data securely using WordPress's options API.
    - Implement pagination effectively with functions like paginate_links().

    Key Conventions
